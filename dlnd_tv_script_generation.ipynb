    "There are many hyperparameters and they all have there own uses, but the main reasons to change a hyperparameter is to optimize the following: training speed, training loss divergence speed, validation loss divergence speed, and CPU/GPU memory resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Number of Epochs:\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of epochs is the number of iterations the model will train for. I set the number of epochs to `num_epochs = 5` to test and set how low my loss could get as I play with my other hyperparameters. Once I had my hyperparmeters close, I increased the number of epochs to `num_epochs = 10` because I was able to reach a 3.5% validation loss befor 10 epochs. These 10 epochs took 2 days to train my model. \n",
    "\n",
    "I also implimented a tequnique that stops the training session if the validation loss has stopped decreaseing after a while. This is called earlier stopping. If after 15 batches we generate another validation loss greater than the minimum validation loss, we stop the current epoch and save the model. If the model generate another validation loss less than the minimum validation loss, we also save the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Batch Size\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the standard batch sizes used:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, \\cdots, 512 $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "A batch is a dataset sent throught your model for a the forward pass, calculating training error, and the backpropagate to calculate new weights for each node in each layer. The smaller the batch size the slower ther training process will be, because there is less data to affect the new node weights. The larger the batch size the slower the calculation takes because there is to much data to calculate the new node weights. This means our memory is to small for tthe calculation the preform with speed. There is a middle ground, the sweet spot, where the CPU or GPU can handle the calculation size while the batch size is still large and can make a significant change in the nodes weight towards a local or hopefully a global minima.\n",
    "\n",
    "I started my batch size at `batch_size = 32` but increased to `batch_size = 64`. This change was to increase my model's training speed while not over increase and creating a calculation that is to large. I didn't go test larger even though this might of inceased speed and decreased validation loss. I thought 64 was working well enough to get to 3.5% validation loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequence Lengths:\n",
    "\n",
    "My sequence length was picked with a simple idea in mind. I pick `sequence_length = (math.ceil(average_word_count_line)00)*2` to try and create a sequence with 2 lines going in model to train at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Rate:\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning rate is one of the most important hyperparameters. The standard way to start ajusting the learning rate is to use `0.1`, `0.01`, `0.001`, `0.0001`, `0.00001`, `0.000001` and so on. The smaller the learning rate, the longer the training will take. Plus, you can get stuck in a local minima rather than reaching the global minima. The larger the learning rate is the fast you can train, but may reach a point of that is never a local minima nor global minima.\n",
    "\n",
    "I did some interesting things to optimize my learning rate. I started by testing with `learning_rate = 0.001` and then `learning_rate = 0.0001` and found that 0.0001 was to slow, so started with 0.001. With 0.001 as my initial learning rate, I went on to use learning rate decay, which will decreate the rate of a number of epochs. I decreased the learning rate by 0.1 after 5 epochs. That means for 10 epochs the first 5 I use 0.001,  and then the second 5 epochs the learning rate decreased to 0.0001. The moment right before, during, and right after this happen during training the result are printed as the following:\n",

    "### Dropout Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "My model uses dropout layers to prevent overfitting the model to the dataset. A good indication of a model overfit is when the training loss is smaller than the validation loss. The dropout layer locks a hidden layer node in order to strengthen the models training and validation loss ratio. We apple a probabilty that a layer's node will be locked for a given batch. Locking the node will help other layers and nodes find their global minima by removing a possible cruch that another node might be. \n",
    "\n",
    "I used a high dropout rate of `dropout=0.5`. This is from a range from 0 to 1. This rate may have slowed my model down on over training speed because it would need more epoch iteations to make changes across the models hidden layers but it made sure that the training would not overfit the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vocabulary Size & Output Size\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Embedding Dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "The embedding dimension should be set to reflect the size of the distinctive vocabulary which hold the most power and meaning for the model. The size is around 1-5% of the original vocabulary dataset. This is why I choose the embedding dimension to be `embedding_dim = 200`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hidden Dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "The hidden dimemention is number of nodes that will be in each hidden layer. This value normally follows the convention:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, \\cdots, 2048 $$ \n",
    " \n",
    "I experimented with 256 and 512 and found 512 gave me a lowed starting loss so I stuck with it. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hidden Layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the hidden layer is dephth of how many hidden layers a found in the RNN. The model will begin to overfit if you increase he hidden layer. Again, A good indication of a model overfitting is when the training loss is smaller than the validation loss. We add dropout to our model to prevent the overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
